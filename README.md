# Handwritten_Digits_recognition_MNIST
Here, I am creating a Neural network from scratch using only numpy arrays which will be able to recognise handwritten digits. The data used to train the model is MNIST dataset. I have also added L2 regularisation and some intelligent weights initialisation techniques to compare the results at the end.
